  <h1>Dark Mode but really this time</h1>
  <p>
    OK, today let's try to make a page that actually turns dark if you have some sort of dark mode set in your OS or
    browser. I've seen some blog posts around the internet about this, but let's actually try and see what we can up
    with by going to the source. Namely, MDN's page about dark mode.
